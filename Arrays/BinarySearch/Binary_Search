Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target,
write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0, end = nums.length-1;
        while(start <= end){
            int mid = (start+end)/2;
            if(nums[mid] == target){
                return mid;
            }else if(nums[mid] < target){
                start = mid+1;
            }else end = mid-1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}

Time Complexity : O(Log N)
